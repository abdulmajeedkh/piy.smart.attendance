 PIY Attendance API

A modular Clean Architecture ASP.NET Core 9 Web API project for managing class attendance in an educational environment. This solution demonstrates enterpriselevel software practices with clear separation of concerns, scalable structure, and industry standards. 
This project is designed as a portfolioready showcase to present professional development skills in ASP.NET Core, EF Core, Clean Architecture, and API Design.

 📌 Features
 Student Management – Add and manage students with class assignments.
 Class Management – Create and organize classes.
 Lecture Management – Schedule lectures with autogenerated QR tokens for attendance marking.
 Attendance Tracking – Students mark attendance by submitting QR tokens.
 Clean Architecture – Separation of Domain, Application, Contracts, Infrastructure, and Host layers.
 Entity Framework Core – Codefirst approach with migrations.
 Swagger Integration – API documentation and testing.
 Extensible Design – Ready for integration with Authentication, Logging, Validation, and Reporting.

 🔹 Domain (piy.attendance.domain)
 Entities: Student, Class, Lecture, Attendance
 Business rules and relationships only (no dependencies).
 

 🔹 Contracts (piy.attendance.app.contract)
 DTOs for API communication.
 Service interfaces for abstraction.
 

 🔹 Application (piy.attendance.app)
 Implements business logic.
 Manages EF Core DbContext and migrations.
 Contains services (StudentService, ClassService, LectureService, AttendanceService).
 

 🔹 Host (piy.attendance.host)
 Entry point Web API project.
 Controllers expose RESTful endpoints.
 Configures Dependency Injection, Swagger, EF Core.
